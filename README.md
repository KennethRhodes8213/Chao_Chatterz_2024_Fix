** Not that great with Github anymore but these files were originally from [Justin-R-J-Logan's fix](https://github.com/byond-dev/Chao_Chatterz/pull/1) so I literally just cut out some expressions that are no longer used. **

# Chao_Chatterz
A repository with the latest public source for the [BYOND](http://www.byond.com/) game [Chao Chatterz](http://www.byond.com/games/GoldDean/ChaoChatterz). It was originally made by [Gold Dean](http://www.byond.com/members/GoldDean) and publicly released on August 30, 2005. The latest update by Gold Dean was released on December 10, 2013. Chao Chatterz is an open-world roleplaying game with the real limits being the map-size and your imagination.

Once I have time to get around to it, I'll begin making efforts to update parts of the code to be better ran in the latest versions of BYOND.

At this time there is no copyright license as Gold Dean had never made it clear how he intended it to be licensed. I have made attempts in the past to contact him, and will occasionally retry my efforts in the future in an effort to better protext the BYOND community and the original creator of the game.
